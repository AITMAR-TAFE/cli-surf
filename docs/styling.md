# Styling

## Code Style and Quality

The [PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) styling convention is used.

To make sure you are following it, you can install [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)

`pip install black`

To run black:

`black .`

On a push/pull request, git will run `black .` for you!
